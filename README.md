# Multi-Factor-Authentication
This project is a simple multi-factor authentication (MFA) application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application allows users to register, log in with their email and password, and verify their identity with a one-time password (OTP) sent to their email.
